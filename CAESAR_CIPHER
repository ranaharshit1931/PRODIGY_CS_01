# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Prodigy Cybersecurity Internship Task 1

## 📌 Task Description

This project is part of the **Prodigy Cybersecurity Internship** – Task 1: Implement the **Caesar Cipher**.

The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique used in classical cryptography. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This project includes both encryption and decryption functions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypts plain text using Caesar Cipher logic
- Decrypts the cipher text using the same shift value
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters
- Ignores and preserves non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program prompts the user for a message and a shift value (key).
- It then encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- After encryption, it automatically decrypts the message using the reverse shift.

## 📁 Files

- `caesar.py` – Main Python file containing the Caesar Cipher logic.
